## Definitions
I will start by defining what *exactly* I mean by each of the words in the title. This is to prevent any confusion with my position and to help see what I am seeing.
### Christian
With where society is at with Christianity. It will be helpful to fence what I mean by Christian. Here are 5 points that I would use when describing a Christian: 
1. **Those who have been renerated with an effectual call.** They have been given a new heart and spiritual life (John 3:3), drawing them irresistibly to Christ (2 Timothy 1:9).
2. **Those who have a saving faith.** A wholehearted trust and reliance *solely* upon Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9), this faith is understood as a gift from God (WSC Q. 86).
3. **Those who have repenantce unto life.** Saving faith is always accompanied by repentance -a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a turning away from it, and a sincere turning towards God and His commands (Acts 20:21), again, as a grace from God.
4. **Those who have been justified.** The believer has been declared righteous by God, not on their merits but solely on Christ's righteousness being imputed (credited) to them (Romans 3:24-25a, Heidelberg Q. 60).
5. **Those who have union with Christ.** The believer is united with Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17) and adopted into God's family as His child.

When I refer to Christian, I do not refer to those who fall into the reformed baptist category, but those who are heirs with Christ with me. This includes people such as Sam Waldron to Mike Winger.

### Christian Nationalism
Christian nationalism is a totality of national action, consisting of civil laws and social customs, conducted by a Christian nation as a Christian nation, in order to procure for itself both earthly and heavenly good in Christ. (*The Case for Christian Nationalism*, Stephen Wolfe)

### Ethnocentric
Ethnocentric is the

## Systematic Theology
Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
## Historical Theology
### 1. **The Two Kingdoms Theology**
Reformed theologians such as **John Calvin**, **Martin Luther**, and later **Abraham Kuyper** developed or supported variations of "Two Kingdoms Theology." The idea is that God governs the world in two distinct ways:
- The **spiritual kingdom:** Governed by the church through the preaching of the Word and administration of the sacraments.
- The **civil kingdom:** Governed by the magistrate or civil authorities, responsible for justice, order, and societal well-being.

This distinction underscores the separation of the church's mission (spiritual renewal) from the purposes of the state (peace and justice). The Reformed theologians warned against merging these two kingdoms too closely. For example, the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) emphasizes the church's independence from the state while granting the state authority to enforce God's moral law in civil matters.
### 2. **Magisterial Views on Church and State**
The early Reformers, including Calvin, viewed the state as an institution ordained by God to uphold righteousness and justice, but they stopped short of endorsing what we might call "ethnocentric nationalism." While Calvin himself supported Geneva being governed by Christian principles, this was more about leading a godly society under God's law, not exalting one nation or ethnic group as inherently superior. Calvin believed that all nations and peoples were under God's sovereign rule, and his theology did not promote nationalism or ethnic favoritism.
### 3. **Covenant Theology**
Reformed theologians have most often interpreted the idea of Christian identity through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the global and multi-ethnic nature of God's redemptive plan. From the Abrahamic covenant onward, God's promises are extended to _all nations_ through Christ (Galatians 3:28–29). This undercuts any theological justification for ethnocentric nationalism, as the gospel is for "Jew and Gentile" alike.
Key figures like **Herman Bavinck** emphasized that in Christ, salvation is global, crossing all cultural and national boundaries, erasing any sense of superiority based on ethnicity or nationality.
### 4. **Warnings Against Idolatry**
Reformed theology has historically been critical of idolatry in any form, including the idolatry of the state or cultural identity. Figures like **Augustine** (who strongly influenced Reformed thought through his work _The City of God_) differentiated between the "City of God" (God's eternal rule) and the "City of Man" (temporal earthly governments). Nationalist ideologies that prioritize earthly nations or elevate them to ultimate significance would be seen as idolatrous from this perspective.
### 5. **Abraham Kuyper and Sphere Sovereignty**
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Dutch Reformed theologian **Abraham Kuyper** articulated the concept of "sphere sovereignty." He argued that God has established different spheres of authority—family, church, state, education, etc.—and each sphere has its own distinct role under God's overall sovereignty. Governments, according to Kuyper, must respect the independence of the church and other societal spheres and should not coercively impose one particular religious viewpoint.
While Kuyper spoke of the importance of a distinctly Christian influence in public life, this influence was not to be confused with nationalism. Kuyper was opposed to ethnocentrism and favored the development of a pluralistic society under God's overarching sovereignty.
### 6. **Historical Critique of Nationalism**
Post-Reformation theologians often critiqued the dangers of nationalism, especially in light of events like the European wars of religion and later political conflicts. Ethnocentric or exclusionary nationalism was viewed as antithetical to the universal church of Christ, which transcends national and ethnic boundaries.
Reformed theologians in the 20th and 21st centuries, such as **J. Gresham Machen** and **Carl F.H. Henry**, warned against conflating the Christian faith with any particular political ideology or national identity. They emphasized the priority of the gospel mission over political or national interests.
