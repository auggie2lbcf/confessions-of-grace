## Definitions
I will start by defining what *exactly* I mean by each of the words in the title. This is to prevent any confusion with my position and to help see what I am seeing.
### Christian
With where society is at with Christianity. It will be helpful to fence what I mean by Christian. Here are 5 points that I would use when describing a Christian: 
1. **Those who have been renerated with an effectual call.** They have been given a new heart and spiritual life (John 3:3), drawing them irresistibly to Christ (2 Timothy 1:9).

4. **Those who have been justified.** The believer has been declared righteous by God, not on their merits but solely on Christ's righteousness being imputed (credited) to them (Romans 3:24-25a, Heidelberg Q. 60).
5. **Those who have union with Christ.** The believer is united with Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17) and adopted into God's family as His child.
