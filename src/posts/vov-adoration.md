**Introduction**

1. The Valley of Vision
    1. Compiled by Arthur Bennett
2. Who Was compiled
3. Preface
   The book is not intended to be read as a prayer manual. The soul learns
   to pray by praying; for prayer is communion with a transcendent and
   immanent God who on the ground of his nature and attributes calls forth
   all the powers of the redeemed soul in acts of total addoration and
   dedication. The prayers should therefore be used as **aspiration units**, the several parts of which could become springboards for the individual's own prayer subjects.
4. How does theses menâ€™s view of God affect their adoration
