## Series Introduction

The Valley of Vision, edited by Arthur Bennett and published in 1975, is a compilation of Puritan prayers and devotions.
Bennett intended it not as a static manual, but as a catalyst for active communion with God,
emphasizing that prayer is learned through practice. This deep engagement involves adoration and dedication,
with the collected prayers designed as "aspiration units" to inspire the reader's own communication with God.

This analysis will explore The Valley of Vision through the structural lens provided by Matthew Henry’s work,
*A Method for Prayer*. Henry's framework organizes prayer into Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Petition, and Intercession.
Using this method, the series will examine the devotional content within The Valley of Vision.
This initial installment begins the five-part series by focusing specifically on the theology of Adoration expressed in the collection.

## Introduction - Adoration

*I must reverently adore God, as a Being transcendently bright and blessed, self-existent and self-sufficient, an infinite and eternal Spirit who has all perfections in himself, and give him the glory of his titles and attributes.*

**- A Method for Prayer**

Adoration serves as the crucial starting point for both The Valley of Vision's collection of prayers and Matthew Henry's A Method for Prayer.
Think of it this way: true prayer is fundamentally about entering into the presence of God. Before we bring our needs, our failures, or our thanks, we must first acknowledge who it is we are approaching. Adoration is the act of focusing our minds and hearts entirely upon God Himself – His character, His attributes, His transcendent glory, His perfect holiness, His infinite power, His unchanging faithfulness, His sovereign love, His boundless mercy. It is praising God simply because He is God, and He is worthy of all praise.
   1. Setting the Proper Perspective: Starting with adoration immediately shifts the focus from ourselves – our problems, our desires, our spiritual state – to the triune God who exists in perfect self-sufficiency and glory. This is crucial because it correctly orders our relationship with the divine. Prayer isn't a transaction where we list demands; it's communion with the Creator and Redeemer. Beginning with His majesty cultivates humility and reverence, acknowledging that we are but dust before the eternal King (Psalm 8:3-4, Isaiah 6:1-5). Both The Valley of Vision and Henry's method implicitly (through the content of the prayers) and explicitly (through the structure) train the believer to adopt this God-centered posture from the outset.
   2. Grounding Other Aspects of Prayer: Adoration provides the necessary foundation for all subsequent elements of prayer:
      * We confess our sins in light of His absolute holiness and perfect standard. Without first adoring His purity, our confession might be merely regret for consequences rather than true repentance born from seeing our sin against Him.
      * We give thanks because of His inherent goodness and the specific mercies that flow from His nature. Our gratitude is rooted in His character, not just our temporary circumstances.
      * We make petitions with faith and submission because of His power to act, His wisdom to know what is best, His promises to His people, and His sovereign will. Adoration reminds us that we pray to one who is able to do "far more abundantly than all that we ask or think" (Ephesians 3:20), yet also one whose plans are perfect.
      * We intercede for others knowing that the God we adore is merciful and powerful to save and sustain.
   3. Reflecting God's Supreme Worth: At the heart of Reformed theology is the conviction that God's glory is the ultimate end of all things, including His creation, redemption, and providence. Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. Adoration is the most direct expression of glorifying God in prayer. By starting here, both The Valley of Vision and Henry reinforce the fundamental truth that God is worthy of worship simply for who He is, and that acknowledging His worthiness is the most fitting way to begin any approach to Him. The Puritan prayers in The Valley of Vision beautifully demonstrate this, often dwelling on God's attributes before moving to personal needs. Henry's method provides a map for the mind and soul to follow this theologically sound path.

In essence, adoration is the "crucial starting point" because it correctly aligns the worshiper with the One being worshiped. It ensures that prayer flows from a right understanding of God's character and our place before Him, preventing it from becoming a self-focused exercise and rooting it firmly in the awe-inspiring reality of who our great God is. It is stepping onto holy ground before presuming to speak further.

### Themes of Adoration

In its prayers, the Valley of Vision acknowledges God in profound and heartfelt ways, often emphasizing His greatness, holiness, sovereignty, and mercy. The prayers reflect a deep understanding of God's transcendence and immanence, with an intimate, personal tone toward the Creator. Here are some key ways in which *The Valley of Vision* acknowledges God:

1. **God's Sovereignty and Majesty**:\
   Many of the prayers in *The Valley of Vision* emphasize God as the sovereign ruler of the universe. Psalm 103:19 declares it, and so do the puritans. He is acknowledged as having supreme authority over all creation. The prayers express awe and reverence for God's power and control over every aspect of life. 

   > "I enter thy presence, worshipping thee with godly fear,
   > awed by thy majesty, greatness, glory,
   > but encouraged by thy love."
   >
   > **Meeting God**

2. **God's Holiness and Purity**:\
   The prayers often emphasize God's perfect holiness, His utter separation from sin, and His moral purity. This serves to highlight human sinfulness in contrast, prompting the prayerful response of confession, repentance, and petition.

   > "Enable us to remember what thou art and what we are,
   > to recall thy holiness and our unworthiness;"
   >
   > **Seventh Day Morning**

3. **God's Mercy and Grace**:\
   The theme of God's mercy and grace is central in these prayers. The Puritans frequently acknowledge God's lovingkindness in forgiving sinners and in offering grace despite human shortcomings.

   > "In spite of the number and heinousness of my sins
   > thou hast given me a token for good;
   > The golden sceptre is held out,
   > and thou hast said ‘Touch it and live’."
   >
   > **Mercy**

4. **Personal Relationship with God**:\
   While acknowledging God's transcendence and majesty, many of the prayers express a deep, personal connection with Him. The Puritans often pray to God as a Father, Shepherd, and Savior, demonstrating an intimate relationship.

   > "When thou art present, evil cannot abide;
   > In thy fellowship is fullness of joy,"
   >
   > **The Great God**

5. **Acknowledging God's Work in Salvation**:\
   The prayers in *The Valley of Vision* reflect a deep understanding of salvation as a work of God alone. They acknowledge the need for Christ's sacrifice and the Spirit's work in renewing and sustaining faith.

   > "I bless thee that thou hast made me capable
   > of knowing thee, the author of all being,
   > of resembling thee, the perfection of all excellency,
   > of enjoying thee, the source of all happiness."
   >
   >  **God Enjoyed**

### Glory

The Valley of Vision doesn’t merely present adoration as abstract reverence—it renders it doxological. Adoration in these prayers naturally moves toward the glorification of God, revealing a rhythm of praise that delights in who God is more than what He gives. The soul, enraptured by the beauty and majesty of God, is drawn upward to give Him glory. The language of the prayers consistently directs attention not inward toward the supplicant’s needs, but upward toward the splendor and sufficiency of God Himself.

This God-centered orientation is especially evident in prayers that begin with humble awe and end in jubilant praise. Consider this line from *Things Needful*:

> “Fill the garden of my soul with the wind of love,
> that the scents of the Christian life may be wafted to others;
> then come and gather fruits to thy glory.
> So shall I fulfil the great end of my being –
> to glorify thee and be a blessing to men.”
>
> **Things Needful**

Here, glory is not only God’s due—it is the believer’s desire. The prayer does not approach God with transaction in mind, but with transformation as its goal: that the heart would be reshaped to delight in God's beauty and magnify His name. Adoration, then, is not merely the first step in prayer; it is the foundation upon which all other expressions—confession, thanksgiving, petition, and intercession—are built.

## Conclusion

In The Valley of Vision, adoration sets the tone for communion with God. Drawing from Matthew Henry’s framework, we see that this adoration is deeply rooted in the character of God—His sovereignty, holiness, mercy, and grace. The prayers lead the soul to see God as He truly is, and in seeing Him, to worship Him rightly.

Adoration is never detached from theology. Each prayer is theologically rich, shaped by a deep understanding of God’s attributes, His redemptive work, and His covenantal faithfulness. This theological weight gives adoration its substance—it is not emotion divorced from truth, but feeling rightly aligned with divine reality.

These prayers teach us that adoration is more than a component of prayer—it is the heart of it. It reminds us that prayer begins not with ourselves, but with God. It forms the soul in humility, lifts the eyes to heaven, and prepares the heart for repentance, gratitude, and dependence.

In the next installment of this series, we will explore the theology of Confession in The Valley of Vision, following Henry’s method to understand how honest acknowledgment of sin forms a vital part of true communion with God.
