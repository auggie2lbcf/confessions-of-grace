## Series Introduction
The Valley of Vision, edited by Arthur Bennett and published in 1975, is a compilation of Puritan prayers and devotions. 
Bennett intended it not as a static manual, but as a catalyst for active communion with God, 
emphasizing that prayer is learned through practice. This deep engagement involves adoration and dedication, 
with the collected prayers designed as "aspiration units" to inspire the reader's own communication with God.

This analysis will explore The Valley of Vision through the structural lens provided by Matthew Henryâ€™s work, 
*A Method for Prayer*. Henry's framework organizes prayer into Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Petition, and Intercession. 
Using this method, the series will examine the devotional content within The Valley of Vision. 
This initial installment begins the five-part series by focusing specifically on the theology of Adoration expressed in the collection.
## Introduction - Adoration
*I must reverently adore God, as a Being transcendently bright and  blessed, self-existent and self-sufficient, an infinite and eternal Spirit who has all perfections in himself, and give him the glory of his titles and attributes.*

**- A Method for Prayer**

Adoration is the start for *The Valley of Vision* and *A Method for Prayer*. Adoration is the start
