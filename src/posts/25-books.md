I'm currently working on a series exploring _The Valley of Vision_ by Arthur Bennett. It's taking longer than most of my usual articles, as I'm aiming for a deeper dive into the theology behind the prayers. In the meantime, I thought it would be fun to share a list of some of my favorite books (outside of the Bible).

# Non-Fiction
## _Confessions_ by Augustine
Augustine’s _Confessions_ is a raw and powerful testimony of a man transformed by grace. It was my introduction to theology as an adult, thanks to a college church history class that unexpectedly changed my spiritual trajectory. Augustine’s vulnerability, depth, and insight still resonate deeply.
## _Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners_ by John Bunyan
Bunyan’s autobiographical work grabbed me in a way few books have. His struggle with sin, assurance, and the mercy of God felt incredibly personal and relatable. It’s a gripping read that showcases the heart of gospel grace.
## _The Valley of Vision_ by Arthur Bennett
This collection of Puritan prayers was a gift that turned into a spiritual treasure. It showed me the beauty of rich, reverent, and theologically rooted prayer—and has been shaping my devotional life ever since.
## _None Greater_ by Matthew Barrett
I skipped a data structures class to finish this book—it was that compelling. Barrett’s clear, rich presentation of classical theism opened my eyes to the majesty of God. It also became a gateway for my wife into Reformed theology.
## _Holiness_ by J.C. Ryle
Ryle’s writing is both pastoral and piercing. _Holiness_ is a wake-up call to pursue godliness with seriousness and joy. It’s a book that continues to challenge and encourage me.
## _Algorithms_ by Panos Louridas
It might seem like a curveball on a Reformed blog, but as a software developer, this book speaks to another side of my world. Louridas presents complex ideas clearly and practically—something I really appreciate in both theology and tech.
## _Reformed Preaching_ by Joel Beeke
This book elevated my view of preaching. Beeke beautifully connects the heart of Reformed theology with the soul-stirring purpose of preaching that not only informs but transforms.
## _Gentle and Lowly_ by Dane Ortlund
This book came like a balm. Ortlund’s emphasis on the heart of Christ—tender, welcoming, and kind—ministered to my soul in a unique and needed way. It’s gospel medicine.
## _Brothers, We Are Not Professionals_ by John Piper
Piper’s call to seriousness in ministry and passion for God’s glory has had a deep influence on me. This book reminds me why pastoral ministry is a sacred, soul-shaping calling.
## _Church History_ by Eusebius
Though ancient and sometimes dense, Eusebius provides a fascinating window into the early church. It reminds me that our faith is deeply rooted in real history and real people.
## _Reformed Systematic Theology_ by Joel Beeke & Paul Smalley
This is a theological feast. It’s thorough, pastoral, and deeply devotional—a rare combination. I keep coming back to it for insight and encouragement.
## _Building Healthy Churches Series_ by 9Marks
Practical, biblical, and immensely helpful for thinking through church life. This series has sharpened my understanding of the local church’s purpose and structure.
## _True Worship_ by Landon Jones
Worship is often misunderstood or misapplied, but Jones draws us back to its theological roots. This book helped me think more biblically about how and why we worship.
## _The Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment_ by Jeremiah Burroughs
Burroughs offers a timely message for any age. This Puritan classic challenged me to find peace not in circumstance but in Christ.
## _Baptist Symbolics_ by James Renihan
Rich, historical, and careful, this book gave me a deeper appreciation for Baptist confessional theology and its continuity with the broader Reformed tradition.
## _Humility: The Joy of Self-Forgetfulness_ by Gavin Ortlund
A short but soul-searching read. Ortlund helps us see humility not as self-deprecation but as Christ-centered joy.
## _Disciplines of a Godly Man_ by R. Kent Hughes
My dad and I went through this when I first got serious about my faith. It was formative in shaping my understanding of what it means to walk with God as a man.
## _Missions by the Book_ by Alex Kocman & Chad Vegas
This book’s biblical focus on missions is refreshing and convicting. It cuts through pragmatism and points us back to Scripture as the foundation for global mission work.
## _Missionary Theologian_ by E.D. Burns
Burns bridges theology and missions beautifully. This book challenges us not to separate heart-stirring theology from gospel-driven action.
## _The Art of Man-Fishing_ by Thomas Boston
A short but potent reflection on evangelism. Boston reminds us of the urgency and spiritual depth involved in “fishing for men.”
## _The Case for Christianity_ by Tim Keller
Keller’s apologetic work is gentle yet robust. This book helped shape how I approach conversations about faith with skeptics and seekers.

# Fiction
## _Pilgrim's Progress_ by John Bunyan
A timeless Christian allegory, _Pilgrim’s Progress_ is rich with imagery and theological depth. It laid the foundation for my appreciation of Bunyan’s other works and continues to offer wisdom for the journey of faith.
## _The Chronicles of Narnia_ by C.S. Lewis
Imaginative and profound, Lewis's Narnia series weaves theology into story so naturally. These tales still stir wonder and reflection, no matter how many times I read them.
## _The Princess Bride_ by William Goldman
This one’s just fun. My dad read it to us, and its quirky humor and heart still make it one of my favorite stories. It’s a tale of adventure, love, and laughter that never gets old.
## _The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings_ by J.R.R. Tolkien
Tolkien’s epic world-building was part of my childhood, with my dad reading these aloud to us. The stories of courage, loyalty, and hope still hold a special place in my heart—despite the movies not quite living up to the magic of the books!
